# Project-10
 Full Stack App with React and a REST API

Create a client for your existing school database REST API (that i created in a previous project). The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.
